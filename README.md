# NYC_green_taxi_DW

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing New York City green taxi trip records (January 2020 to October 2024) to track revenue, uncover temporal and spatial trends, and inform operational decision-making. By combining data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes with a star schema design, it creates a centralized data warehouse for efficient analytical queries.
